# Handle _netdev devices
# You can specify your iSCSI (LVMed or Multipathed or DM Encrypted) devices

# Additional mounts to exclude at shutdown.
#
# If you have additional mounts on iSCSI that shouldn't be umounted at
# shutdown by open-iscsi (by default, open-iscsi excludes / and on
# systemd systems als /usr), place them here. iSCSI sessions that carry
# these mounts will also be kept open.
#
# If any of these mountpoints contain spaces, please use the same
# escaping as in /etc/fstab, i.e. replace the spaces with \040.

# Don't logout from ANY iSCSI session on shutdown
#
# When shutting down, if the root filesystem is on iSCSI, open-iscsi
# tries to determine which sessions are still required for the root
# filesystem. By default, the host will still logout from all other
# sessions.
#
# If you are running a very complicated setup of your root filesystem
# (multiple mapping levels stacked on top of each other), it may be the
# case that the autodetection logic doesn't work propery. You may then
# enable this setting to keep around all iSCSI sessions.
#
# Note that /etc/iscsi/iscsi.initramfs must exist for this option to
# have any effect at all.
#
# This was the default behavior in previous versions of this package
# up to the version that shipped with Debian 8 (Jessie).
